# Show-n-Tell

## Description

This game was created to test the user on JavaScript knowledge and ability to complete the test before the time runs out. My motivation is to test and retain new JavaScript knowlegde. This quiz helps make studying fun! This solves the problem of not knowing exactly what to study and test on JavaScript objectives.
